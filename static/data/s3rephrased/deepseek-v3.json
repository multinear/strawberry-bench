R at Position 3 \u2013 **First \"R.\"**\n2. R at Position 8 \u2013 **Second \"R.\"**\n3. R at Position 9 \u2013 **Third \"R.\"**\n\nThe count remains consistent at three \"R\"s.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully examining each letter in \"strawberry,\" I've determined that the letter \"R\" appears **three times**.\n\n**Final Answer:** The word \"strawberry\" contains three \"R\"s.",

In the standard pronunciation of \"strawberry,\" the 'R' at the end is pronounced, so we still count it. If the pronunciation includes a silent 'R,' it would not be counted. However, in this case, since all 'R's are pronounced, the count remains three.\n\nTherefore, the letter 'R' appears three times in the word \"strawberry.\"",
